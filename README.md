This is my personal website.

This was my first time using react, so there was definitely a learning curve and there are still numerous areas in which I can grow. I spent a lot of time trying out different designs and eventually settled on this simple design that allowed me to focus on my content and how to implement each component in React. I also learned how to deploy websites in GitHub.
